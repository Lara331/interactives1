    <p> Beyonce took home two other awards this year, including:
        <ul>
            <li> Best Country Album (Cowboy Carter)</li>
            <li> Best Country Duo/Group Performance (II Most Wanted feat. Miley Cyrus)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> The singer was first nominated for Album of the Year in 2010 for her work, "I Am...Sasha Fierce." She lost that year to Taylor Swift for the former country singer turned pop sensation's hit album, "Fearless."</p>

    <p> Beyonce's win comes after a long history of snubs from the Recording Academy. The singer has been nominated for Album of the Year four times, including for her critically acclaimed album, "Lemonade," in 2017. She lost that year to Adele's "25."</p>
    <p> Beyonce released Cowboy Carter in April 2024. The album explores her rejection from the country music world, and her reclamation of the genre through honoring black country and folk history. While she got snubbed at the Country Music Awards in December, the Grammys was certainly her night. </p> 
    <p> Cowboy Carter had an impressive discography with 27 songs and collaboratons including Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone. </p>
