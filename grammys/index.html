    <p> Beyonce took home two other awards this year, including:
        <ul>
            <li> Best Country Album (Cowboy Carter)</li>
            <li> Best Country Duo/Group Performance (II Most Wanted feat. Miley Cyrus)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p> The singer was first nominated for Album of the Year in 2010 for her work, "I Am...Sasha Fierce." She lost that year to Taylor Swift for the former country singer turned pop sensation's hit album, "Fearless."</p>

    <p> Beyonce's win comes after a long history of snubs from the Recording Academy. The singer has been nominated for Album of the Year four times, including for her critically acclaimed album, "Lemonade," in 2017. She lost that year to Adele's "25."</p>
    <p> Beyonce released Cowboy Carter in April 2024. The album explores her rejection from the country music world, and her reclamation of the genre through honoring black country and folk history. While she got snubbed at the Country Music Awards in December, the Grammys was certainly her night. </p> 
    <p> Cowboy Carter had an impressive discography with 27 songs and collaboratons including Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone. </p>

    <p> How I reported this story: 
        I used three embed tools for this story; a YouTube embed link, a Spotify embed link and a Knight Lab image juxtapose embed link. I really enjoyed making this story and being able to use these interactive elements, because they bring the article to life in a relevant and engaging way. This story about Beyonce and her music was able to come alive by viewers being able to directly listen to her album from the story, and seeing her acceptance speech makes readers feel like they could experience her win. I also loved the juxtapose tool because it allows me to visualize the change over time that I discussed in the body of the article. These tools were fairly simple to use but dramatically elevated the quality of the story, and allowed me to tell a more complete narrative. Audiences reading about Beyonce and her Grammy wins will be able to see and hear what got her those awards, rather than just reading about it.
